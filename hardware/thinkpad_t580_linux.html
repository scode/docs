<h2 id="ubuntu-compatibility"><a class="header" href="#ubuntu-compatibility">Ubuntu compatibility</a></h2>
<p>This was originally written based on experience using Unbutu 17.10. As
of 2018-10-07 I have upgraded to upgraded to Ubuntu 18.04 and
preliminarily everything seems to work comparably. I tried booting the
18.04 live USB, but I have not performed an installation of 18.04 from
scratch.</p>
<h2 id="the-touchpad"><a class="header" href="#the-touchpad">The touchpad</a></h2>
<p>The touchpad is physically clickable <em>but</em> it appears to use a
"hinged" design, with the hinge being on top. In other words, clicking
the very bottom of the touchpad works fine and only requires a small
amonunt of force (and it differentiates between the left/right side to
simulate left/right mouse buttons).</p>
<p>The further up the touchpad you go, the harder you need to press to
generate a click. The implication is that as you move your hand around
while moving the cursor, it's a crapshoot as to what it feels like to
click the touchpad - and if you're far up enough you end up with a lot
of "ugh the click didn't take" situations.</p>
<p>My only explanation for this design is that the touchpad is not intended
to be a clickable touchpad in the sense you'd expect of a MacBook, but
rather that it is intended to behave as if you had dedicated buttons on
the bottom of the touchpad (the actual dedicated physical buttons are on
top).</p>
<p>That is not really how I want to use a touchpad. I pretty quickly
stopped trying to get used to it, and am instead trying to get used to
the trackpoint.</p>
<h2 id="trackpoint"><a class="header" href="#trackpoint">TrackPoint</a></h2>
<p>As mentioned above, the touchpad is not really to my taste. Therefore, I
used the trackpoint exclusively for the first few months of use.</p>
<p>I <em>did</em> get "used" to it in the sense that usage was natural to me.
However, I never became anywhere near as fast as I am with a Macbook
Touchpad, and I never shook the feeling of being "restricted" and
uncomfortable when needing to do something pointer heavy.</p>
<p>As a result I decided to get an external mouse and keyboard + the
docking station which I now use whenever I'm at my desk. I still use
the TrackPoint regularly and it remains servicable if not pleasant.</p>
<p>This topic is of course highly subjective and I know many people love
trackpoints. But the above is my experience, and figured I would share
it.</p>
<p>(As an aside, the <a href="https://smile.amazon.com/gp/product/B00UUBIM0E/ref=oh_aui_search_detailpage?ie=UTF8&amp;psc=1">CODE 87-Key Cherry MX
Brown</a>
has been a great keyboard for me. Note there are variants with other
Cherry MX switches. Also for some reason it is currently listed with an

<p>This definitely irks me a lot, but I'm <em>mostly</em> okay with it. It is
legit annoying, especially when using the laptop in my actual lap,
because of the balance is off but also because there isn't as good
support for my palm/arm on the left hand side as there is on the right
hand side.</p>
<p>I should note that this is my private laptop, and the nature of my use
is very different than my work laptop. In particular, I don't tend to
use it constantly for 12 hours or similar things, and I do worry what
would happen if I used it more intensively.</p>
<h2 id="noise"><a class="header" href="#noise">Noise</a></h2>
<p>Spinning a single CPU core for several seconds appears approximately
enough to cause the fan to run at a noticable volume. I don't really
mind for most cases since I have noise canceling headphones with music
in them most of the time. However, it would be enough that I think it
will bother me to use the T580 as the chrome casting source if watching
TV w/o headphones in the living room with the laptop next to me, for
example. (This assumes the browser is streaming video; i.e. use of
chrome cast with a non-supported site.)</p>
<p>I would not call it terribly loud, but noticeably so. I am generally not
super sensitive to noise compared to some folks, for whatever that is
worth in terms of calibration.</p>
<h2 id="keyboard"><a class="header" href="#keyboard">Keyboard</a></h2>
<p>As usual with Thinkpads, the keyboard is quite good even if not as good
as the classic Thinkpads of old. The primary "annoyance" for me
compared with what I've become used to with MacBooks is that the arrow
keys are small and stuffed in with other keys making them harder/more
risky to use.</p>
<p>This isn't a big deal for me since all my heavy duty keyboard use (text
editing) does not involve use of arrow keys, but it does affect certain
random things where I don't have other bindings.</p>
<h2 id="battery"><a class="header" href="#battery">Battery</a></h2>
<p>The large cylindrical battery (which is opt-in when you purchase the
laptop) sticks out from the laptop and acts as a "foot" for the
laptop - slightly elevating the back of it. I have no problem with this
myself, but I wanted to mention it in case some folks may prefer it
flush.</p>
<p>In terms of battery time, all these experiences based on using Linux and
i3; other operating systems, or potentially graphically heavy desktop
environments, may see different results.</p>
<p>With both batteries fully charged, it appears that sitting around idling
with the screen on and reasonably (but not maximally) bright, I can get
<em>around</em> 12 hours.</p>
<p>Playing a typical 1080p YouTube video (without video decoding
acceleration) it's <em>around</em> 5-6 hours.</p>
<p>These numbers are currently based on the battery estimate given to me by
<code>acpi</code>. I have not spent time measuring how correct they are, or down
full draining to confirm rate of reported discharge doesn't change.
That said, it feels roughly consistent with what I've experienced when
spending multiple hours off battery and keeping a casual eye on battery
levels.</p>
<h3 id="battery-problems-possibly-gone-with-bios-update"><a class="header" href="#battery-problems-possibly-gone-with-bios-update">Battery problems, possibly gone with BIOS update</a></h3>
<p>The behavior I observed at first was that the large cylindrical battery
would be drained first, followed by the smaller battery. This makes
sense, since one may want to use the built-in battery as the bridge to
allow a battery swap. Upon charging it would fill up the built-in
battery first, followed by the cylindrical.</p>
<p>I started observing some anomalies with respect to the wrong battery
draining, and the charging happening in the wrong order. Finally, I
ended up in a state where the built-in battery would just not charge,
even when drained all the way down to 37%.</p>
<p>After much ado, I got a USB CD drive and CDR discs, and did a BIOS
update using Lenovo's bootable CD (I had some trouble converting it
into a bootable USB stick). Sorry, I lost the exact bios version but
this was done early April or late Mars and using whatever was the latest
BIOS version at the time.</p>
<p>After the BIOS update, it successfully charged the smaller built-in
battery. However, after charging it fully (it was at like 99%), it kept
simmering on the built-in battery for I think even hours and I was
worried that it would never swap over and charge the larger battery.</p>
<p>I left it overnight and in the morning the larger battery was charged.</p>
<p>I have not exercised the battery a lot, and so lack further anecdotes.</p>
<h2 id="linux-compatibility-and-tweaks"><a class="header" href="#linux-compatibility-and-tweaks">Linux compatibility and tweaks</a></h2>

<h3 id="xorg-driver--avoiding-screen-tearing"><a class="header" href="#xorg-driver--avoiding-screen-tearing">xorg driver + avoiding screen tearing</a></h3>
<p>The <code>modesetting</code> driver appears to be picked by default by Xorg on this
laptop, and there is signficant screen tearing noticable when doing
simple things like scrolling a web page.</p>
<p>A solution is to force the <code>intel</code> driver to be used, <em>and</em> to enable
the <code>TearFree</code> option (I don't know what the trade-off is; presumably
there is <em>some</em> trade-off if it's not enabled by default).</p>
<p>In my case, I dropped the following into a file in
<code>/usr/share/X11/xorg.conf.d</code>:</p>
<pre><code>Section "Device"
      Identifier  "card0"
      Driver      "intel"
      Option      "TearFree" "true"
EndSection

<h3 id="wayland"><a class="header" href="#wayland">Wayland</a></h3>
<p>My only use of wayland has been through the default Ubuntu desktop that
uses Wayland+XWayland. Seems to superficially work, but I spent as
little time as possible in this mode until I got my i3 environment
bootstrapped.</p>
<p>There was no particular problem with Wayland, and I may still try it
out. However, my priority was getting my environment set up rather than
playing with Wayland. I am hopeful Wayland will work well and that
<a href="https://github.com/swaywm/sway">sway</a> is a good i3 replacement - I just
don't know yet.</p>
<h3 id="suspendresume"><a class="header" href="#suspendresume">Suspend/resume</a></h3>
<p>I have one problem with suspend/resume: If I suspend the laptop while an
external mouse (USB) is connected, it won't resume again and I have to
reset it. I have not done any debugging of the issue.</p>
<p>Outside of that, suspend/resume has been fully reliable. Resume seems to
take maybe 2-3 seconds or so.</p>
<h3 id="bluetooth-audio"><a class="header" href="#bluetooth-audio">Bluetooth audio</a></h3>
<p>My use of Bluetooth audio is almost entirely for watching videos
(including YouTube) and listening to Audio (in Chrome).</p>
<p>My primary headset is the Bose QC35 (though I have briefly tried the
Avantree Audition as well).</p>
<p>I am using pulseaudio.</p>
<p>I have <em>not</em> tried the microphone; if you care about bluetooth audio
<em>input</em>, I can't help much.</p>
<p>The good news is that overall, Bluetooth works. I did not require any
tweaks w.r.t. bluetooth drivers or bluez etc (the standard <code>pair X</code>,
<code>connect X</code> works), but there are a few quirks/things to keep in mind.</p>
<ul>
<li>
<p>In order to put the headset into the appropriate mode to get high
quality audio, <code>pacmd set-card-profile N a2dp_sink</code> (whatever your
card <code>N</code> is). It appears to be defaulting into a headset profile
(where the mic theoretically works, but audio quality is horrible.)</p>
</li>
<li>
<p>Once (but only once so far), a <em>huge</em> amount of latency built up; it
was on the order of half a second to a second of delay. I "fixed"
it by restarting my headset.</p>
</li>
<li>
<p>During normal operation, latency is low enough that I don't
consciously notice anything annoying. That said, I should mention
that I haven't used this setup to watch a lot of human faces
speaking (though I have some).</p>
</li>
<li>
<p>Contrary to the behavior on macOS, the PulseAudio volume control
does not appear to affect the hardware volume of the headset. I did
not find a way to do this through software, but in the case of the
Bose QC35 there are physical buttons on the headset to control the
hardware volume. The significance of this is that software volume
above 100% will cause distortion, and so it is important that 100%
is sufficient volume. If you have a bluetooth headset without
physical volume buttons, <em>maybe</em> this could be a problem. I'm not
sure.</p>
</li>
<li>
<p>Most of the time, turning on the Bose headset after having resumed
the laptop will either (a) cause it to connect after a couple of
seconds, or (b) require me to turn the headset back off and back on
again and <em>then</em> connect after an additional couple of seconds.</p>
<p>I have had a few cases that required more attempts. Once I spent
almost 5 minutes restarting the headset, flipping <code>scan on/scan off</code>
and doing suspend/resumes until it finally started working.</p>
<p>So TLDR: As usual, Bluetooth pairing/connection is freaking
horrible. However, it has been a bit more horrible than I'm used to
with macOS, though not incredibly so. With macOS you have random
issues sometimes as well, but the biggest difference is that having
to turn the headset on and off an extra time seems to be the common
case right now. But at least it's mostly consistent.</p>
<p>I am not entirely sure what these issues are correlated with, and
whether e.g. suspend/resume cycles make it more likely.</p>
</li>
</ul>
<h3 id="battery-linux"><a class="header" href="#battery-linux">Battery</a></h3>
<p>It's worth nothing that two separate batteries could potentially
complicate matters from a UI perspective.</p>
<p>In my case, I mostly monitor the battery using <code>i3status</code> which will by
default aggregate all batteries in the system (configurable, though I
did not try it).</p>
<p>But, I mention this just in case the reader may anticipate any problems
resulting from the fact that there are multiple batteries exposed
logically through ACPI.</p>
<h3 id="accelerated-video-decoding"><a class="header" href="#accelerated-video-decoding">Accelerated video decoding</a></h3>
<p>Accelerated decoding in Chrome is disabled. I was not able to find a
fix.</p>
<h3 id="the-webcam"><a class="header" href="#the-webcam">The webcam</a></h3>
<p>Very limited testing indicates the webcam works.</p>
<p>One caveat is that Chrome appears to use the <em>infrafed</em> camera by
default (it shows up as <code>/dev/video0</code> with the visible light camera
being <code>/dev/video1</code>). If video capture results in a bunch of green
garbage this is likely what's going on. Chrome's setting for selecting
video device is under "advanced" settings, and under "content"
settings. You pick the device in the same place you managed permissions
to use the camera.</p>
<h3 id="misc-tweaks"><a class="header" href="#misc-tweaks">Misc tweaks</a></h3>
<p>I've done various tweaking to my environment since getting the laptop.
