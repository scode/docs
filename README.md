# docs

Documentation of random things for my own and other people's purposes.

If you are here to read rather than contribute, you may prefer to
look at the [rendered site](http://scode.github.io/docs).

## Publishing

This book is published using `mdbook`. The process is automated
via the `.github/workflows/deploy.yml` GitHub action, which builds
the book and deploys it to the `gh-pages` branch, which is then
served via GitHub pages.
